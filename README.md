Adoption Agency

In this exercise, you’ll build a web application for a Pet Adoption Agency.

Step 1: Create Database & Model
Create a Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy project, “adopt”.

Create a single model, Pet. This models a pet potentially available for adoption:

id: auto-incrementing integer
name: text, required
species: text, required
photo_url: text, optional
age: integer, optional
notes: text, optional
available: true/false, required, should default to available
While setting up the project, add the Debug Toolbar.

Step 2: Make Homepage Listing Pets
The homepage (at route /) should list the pets:

name
show photo, if present
display “Available” in bold if the pet is available for adoption
Step 3: Create Add Pet Form
Create a form for adding pets. This should use Flask-WTF, and should have the following fields:

Pet name
Species
Photo URL
Age
Notes
This should be at the URL path /add. Add a link to this from the homepage.

Step 4: Create Handler for Add Pet Form
This should validate the form:

if it doesn’t validate, it should re-render the form
if it does validate, it should create the new pet, and redirect to the homepage
This should be a POST request to the URL path /add.

Step 5: Add Validation
WTForms gives us lots of useful validators; we want to use these for validating our fields more carefully:

the species should be either “cat”, “dog”, or “porcupine”
the photo URL must be a URL (but it should still be able to be optional!)
the age should be between 0 and 30, if provided
Step 6: Add Display/Edit Form
Make a page that shows some information about the pet:

Name
Species
Photo, if present
Age, if present
It should also show a form that allows us to edit this pet:

Photo URL
Notes
Available
This should be at the URL /[pet-id-number]. Make the homepage link to this.

Step 7: Handle Edit Form
This should validate the form:

if it doesn’t validate, it should re-render the form
if it does validate, it should edit the pet
This should be a POST request to the URL path /[pet-id-number].

Step 8: Clean Up Your Code!
A critical step for any project is to refactor and clean up code; it’s good to do this iteratively, as you work.

Check for:

function names: good functions names are “verby”, like show_add_form
consistent use of good variable names
every class or function should have a docstring describing its purpose
add comments for any parts that would benefit from this
add a file showing all of the Python requirements for this project
